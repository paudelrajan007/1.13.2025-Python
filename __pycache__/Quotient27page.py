# A quotient is the result obtained when one number is divided by another.
# What is a Quotient? (Easy Explanation) ðŸ˜Š
# A quotient is the answer you get when you divide one number by another.
# # Example 1:
# If you divide 10 by 2:
#  10Ã·2=5
# Here, 5 is the quotient.
# For example:

# 10 Ã· 3 â†’ Quotient = 3 (integer part) and remainder = 1.
# 15 Ã· 5 â†’ Quotient = 3, remainder = 0.
